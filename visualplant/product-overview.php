	VISUALPLANT is a platform for companies to upload, manage and distribute video on the Internet.
	We provide software as a service (SaaS) removing the burdens of transcoding and delivery to the 
	Web, mobile and IPTV. Our platform is <a href="cms.php">more complete</a>, 
	accommodates virtually infinite volume and 
	offers no commitment and <a href="pricing.php">lower pricing</a> than our competitors.

	<h3>Product lineage</h3>

	<p>
	
	The founder built v.1 of VISUALPLANT in 2005 to serve 
	his own selfish needs for something that didn't yet exist: a service for non-software developers to launch 
	their own Internet video channels. Drawing from his years of experience designing content management systems
	and Web sites for publishers like BMG and Advertising Age, he started VISUALPLANT from scratch and deliberately 
	built for expansion. VISUALPLANT won its first enterprise client in early 2006. 
	<p>
	In 2009 the software has been reformulated to exploit the benefits of cloud computing offering more 
	features, greater scalability, reduced costs and no committment.
