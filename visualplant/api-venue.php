<strong>VISUALPLANT Venue&trade;</strong> (patent-pending) provides a complete, off-the-shelf, white-label
site matrix comprised of templates served under any remote domain. The templates make 
use of our own Web Services API, come integrated with our <a href="cdn-overview.php">Network of CDNs</a> 
and provide caching for fast load times. These are designed for over-night roll-outs, but also make it 
easy for HTML/CSS designers to make unlimited custom modifications. Set-up is as easy as 
choosing a theme, copying templates to a PHP server (.NET also available) and inputting a passkey &mdash; no need to redirect 
domain names or deal with complicated integrations. Even easier, use our fully-hosted solution and we'll manage all the
technology while you focus on the content.
<p>

Publishers may also use VP Venue (complimented with granular <a href="api-services.php">Web Services</a>) to enable themselves and chosen partners
to create "splinter venues" which extend their brand in a myriad imaginable ways.
Each venue may be <a href="api-security.php">designated unique content privileges, IP restriction, monitored by the publisher
and disabled at any time</a>.
