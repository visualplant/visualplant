	VISUALPLANT LLC is a privately-held design and technology provider based in Los Gatos, CA with dedicated
	technologists in New York, North Carolina and abroad. We offer a video platform that takes exactly what it needs 
	from the cloud to help our clients upload, manage and distribute video. Read our story below or

	<h3>Our story</h3>

	<p>

	We have interest in technology <i>and</i> content, in the medium <i>and</i> the message &mdash; how the two merge to
	become greatness.

	<p>

	For years we were dedicated to designing and developing one-off solutions for clients
	to publish on the Internet. We built content management and media distribution systems, each
	one better in some ways and worse in others than the previous. Many lessons were learned along
	the way.

	<p>

	In 2004, we sought to create our own TV station on the Internet called "IZNO TV". 
	We found no existing solutions to do so. We began building our own "Internet Media Platform."

	<p>

	In 2006, YouTube grew up and consumer platforms flourished. Still, none offered the
	independence and full control of media context that we demanded. We didn't want our
	precious material floating in an oil-slick of consumerism, half-drowned in
	coca-cola commercials as business suits profited from our long hours. Neither did 
	we want it locked in a Flash widget offered under expensive solutions 
	like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightcove" target="_blank">BrightCove</a>.

	<p>

	We saw some other sites we admired popping up, like 
	<a href="http://www.superdeluxe.com/" target="_blank">Super Deluxe<a> 
	and <a href="http://www.vbs.tv/" target="_blank">VBS TV<a>.

	<p>

	Our goal was to enable up-and-coming publishers and established brands to 
	launch media venues or integrate media seamlessly on their exisiting sites without
	requiring negotiations with CDNs, endless technology builds, integrations and closed, turnkey systems.

	<p>

	Our platform was released in early 2005 enabling professional publishers
	like <a href="http://adage.com" target="_blank">Advertising Age</a>,
	<a href="http://creativity-online.com" target="_blank">Creativity (AdCritic.com)</a>
	and <a href="http://crainsny.com" target="_blank">Crains New York Business</a>.

	<p>

	This is the history of what we now offer to you in an auto-scaling, standards-compliant
	platform for Internet video publishing.
